## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a message in the input box.
2. The message is preprocessed (lowercase, tokenized, cleaned, stemmed).
3. The text is vectorized using the **TF-IDF vectorizer**.
4. The classifier model predicts the label: **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
5. The result is displayed instantly on the Streamlit UI.
